        Fixed tests on Windows and on perl < 5.8.7

0.35    2011-01-16
        Added proper support for PerlIO layers, in order to:
         * reliably detect crlf transformations
         * detect and handle utf8 layers
        Use sterror instead of strerror_r when the latter isn't available

0.34    2010-12-04
        Skip remap tests as soon as possible, to avoid failures on non-Linux
        Fixed anonymous mapping on Windows
        Fixed warning on perl < 5.8.8

        Made code C89 compliant again
        Fixed minor issues with strerror_r

        Replaced Readonly by Const::Fast
        Replaced Exporter by Sub::Exporter
        Handle undefined assignment more cleanly

        More fixing related to RT#60710

0.28    2010-08-25
        Made truncation warning do the right thing, unbreaking it on 5.13.3+ (fixes RT#60710)
        Allocate mmap_info in a thread safe manner, preventing a weird class of bugs.
        Removed threads.pm from dependency list (fixes RT#60708)
        Fixed length wrap around bug (RT#56643)
        Added an example: fastsearch
        Suggest to use 5.12 for less buggy behavior on large strings
